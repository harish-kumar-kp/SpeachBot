It consists of the heart, blood, and a network of blood vessels (arteries, veins, and capillaries). The heart, a muscular organ, pumps blood through these vessels in a closed-loop system, ensuring that oxygenated blood reaches the body\u2019s tissues and organs while removing waste products like carbon dioxide. Blood vessels are classified into arteries (which carry blood away from the heart), veins (which bring blood back to the heart), and capillaries (tiny vessels where the exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste occurs). This system plays a vital role in maintaining body temperature, pH balance, and overall homeostasis. The circulatory system also supports the immune system by transporting white blood cells to areas of infection or injury.", "videoLink": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9ONXd_-anM", "imageLink": "https://www.thoughtco.com/thmb/KHjPoXpHSOEayCpFLk0BKLC6Wvs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/GettyImages-97537745-59efa47d6f53ba0011c0070b.jpg", "referenceLink": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system", "keywords": "Topic One,Topic 1,Circulatory "}, {"topicTitle": ["Topic 2", "Topic Two", "Respiratory System"], "contextText": "Organs: Lungs, trachea, bronchi, diaphragm .Function:Provides oxygen to the blood and removes carbon dioxide from the body. Detail: The respiratory system supplies oxygen to the blood and removes carbon dioxide, a waste product of metabolism, from the body. It includes the nasal passages, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and lungs. The process begins with inhalation, where air enters through the nose or mouth, traveling down the trachea and into the bronchi, which branch into smaller bronchioles within the lungs. These end in alveoli, small air sacs where gas exchange occurs. Oxygen from inhaled air diffuses into the bloodstream, while carbon dioxide diffuses out to be exhaled. The diaphragm, a muscle under the lungs, contracts during inhalation and relaxes during exhalation, facilitating airflow. This system works closely with the circulatory system to ensure that all cells receive the oxygen they need for energy production.", "videoLink": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67Jbbu7UZAA", "imageLink": "https://www.visiblebody.com/hs-fs/hub/189659/file-2545156127-jpg/Learn_Articles/Respiratory_System/Set_1_Five_Functions_of_Respiratory_Sys/1C-Respiratory-System.jpg", "referenceLink": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system", "keywords": "Topic Two,Topic 2,Respiratory"}, {"topicTitle": ["Topic 3", "Topic Three", "Digestive System"], "contextText": "Organs: Mouth, esophagus, stomach, intestines, liver, pancreas, gallbladder .Function: Breaks down food into nutrients for energy, growth, and cell repair; eliminates waste. Detail: The digestive system breaks down food into nutrients that the body can absorb and use for energy, growth, and cell repair. It includes organs such as the mouth, esophagus, stomach, intestines, liver, pancreas, and gallbladder. Digestion starts in the mouth, where enzymes in saliva begin breaking down carbohydrates. The food then moves down the esophagus to the stomach, where acids and enzymes further digest it. The partially digested food passes into the small intestine, where most nutrient absorption occurs, aided by enzymes from the pancreas and bile from the liver. The large intestine absorbs water and forms waste, which is excreted through the rectum. The digestive system also plays a role in immune defense, particularly through the gut microbiome, which helps protect against pathogens.", "videoLink": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_T_vmcLyTzI", "imageLink": "https://online-learning-college.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/digestive-system-2048x1317.jpeg", "referenceLink": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_digestive_system", "keywords": "Topic Three,Topic 3,Digestive"}, {"topicTitle": ["Topic 4", "Topic Four", "Nervous System"], "contextText": "Organs: Brain, spinal cord, nerves, sensory organs .Function: Controls body activities by sending signals to and from different body parts; processes sensory information. Detail: The nervous system is the body\u2019s control center, responsible for sending, receiving, and interpreting signals from all parts of the body. It includes the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves. The central nervous system (CNS), composed of the brain and spinal cord, processes information and coordinates responses. The peripheral nervous system (PNS) connects the CNS to limbs and organs, allowing for communication between the brain and the rest of the body. Sensory neurons collect information from the environment, which is processed by the brain, while motor neurons control muscle actions. The autonomic nervous system, a part of the PNS, regulates involuntary activities like heartbeat and digestion.

Smooth muscles, found in organs like the intestines and blood vessels, control involuntary movements like digestion and blood flow.
